Qemu Software
QEMU is a free and open-source emulator. It emulates the machine's processor through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for the machine, enabling it to run a variety of guest operating systems. It can interoperate with Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to run virtual machines at near-native speed. QEMU can also do emulation for user-level processes, allowing applications compiled for one architecture to run on another.
QEMU has multiple operating modes:
*User-mode emulation
*System emulation
*KVM Hosting
*Xen Hosting
QEMU can save and restore the state of the virtual machine with all programs running. Guest operating systems do not need patching in order to run inside QEMU. It supports the emulation of various architectures, including x86, MIPS64 ,SPARC, ARM, SuperH, PowerPC, ETRAX CRIS, MicroBlaze, and RISC-V.
