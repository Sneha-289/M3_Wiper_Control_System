Wipers  may  be  powered  by  a  variety  of  means,  although  most  in  use  today  are  powered  by  an motor  through  a  series  of  mechanical  components.
So  here  we  propose  an  automatic  wiper  system  that  automatically  switches  ON  on  detecting  rain and  stops  when  rain  stops.
project  brings  forward  this  system  to  automate  the  wiper  system having  no  need  for  manual  intervention. 
system  uses  LED  to  detect  rain, so  when  rain  falls  on  it  itâ€™s  circuit  gets completed  and  sends  out  a  signal  and  drive  the  motor  to  simulate  car  wiper system
To  build  a  system  which  would  wipe  out  the  rain  from  any  shield  with  minimum  man power  having  handful  of  systems  automatically  operated  and wiper  system  and make it available  for all purpose.
Three types of LED are used to check for ON and OFF conditions
hence a wiper control system is implemented.
